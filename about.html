Performing approximately 20 concerts each season and with a worldwide audience of more than half-a-million people, the Orchestra embraces a broad repertoire that enables it to reach the most diverse audience of any British symphony orchestra. <br> <span>Whilst artistic integrity remains paramount,</span> BUKO is unafraid to push boundaries and is equally at home recording video game, film and television soundtracks and working with pop stars, as it is performing the great symphonic repertoire. <br> <br>

                    <span>BUKO is a dynamic and versatile ensemble</span> which incorporates performances of a wide range of styles and genres across Norway and around the world. The Orchestra's repertoire includes film music, computer video games scores, music from the musicals, symphonic arrangements of classic rock and pop songs as well as new commissions and the traditional core classical repertoire, reaching a wide and diverse audience of over 10,000 live listeners per year. The Orchestra's creative partnerships with artists, promoters and producers has resulted in ambitious performances in venues from vast arenas to the small intimate setting of a double decker bus. BUKO aims to reach as wide an audience as possible and is unafraid to explore new orchestral experiences.
